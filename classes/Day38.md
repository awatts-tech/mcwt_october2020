# Day 38

## Slides

Angular 70-98

## Overview

Today we are covering two very important topics: Directives and Pipes

A directive allows you to manipulate elements in your HTML using special Angular-specific syntax.

A pipe allows you to transform data coming from your component class by running it through a function, usually built-in to Angular. For example "variable | uppercase" will convert that variable to uppercase as it displays in the browser.
